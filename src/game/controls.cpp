// default.xbe reads the pads into each player's controls in 0xDE720 (cdecl: the players, their count; each player
// 0x158 bytes from 0x1FE6D0): a switch on the player's controller style (the u16 at +0xE: NightFire 0, Moonraker 1,
// Octopussy 2, Goldfinger 3, Dr. No 4, Thunderball 5, GoldenEye 6, Classic Bond 7) picks which stick axis is moving,
// strafing, turning and looking and which button does what. The keys are laid out for style 0's controls page. While
// controller 1 is played on the keyboard and mouse its player's style is 0, so the game's prompts and controls page
// name the buttons the keys play (the pictures show the keys: src/common/buttons.cpp); a controller puts the chosen
// style back, and the profile is written with it (0x6ED30 packs a player's controls for the save and the launch data).
