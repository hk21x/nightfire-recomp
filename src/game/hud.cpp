// hide_hud on foot: the HUD is each player view's 2D sprite list (the cameras at 0x1F661C): the ammo and weapon, the
// health bar, the timer, scores, name tags and hints. The frame's 2D pass (0xDAC20) draws each view's list through
// 0xD9410 (cdecl: the view, the list, first and end index), sprites itself and text through 0x6A340. The menus and
// the pause screen are widgets drawn apart; while one is up (MenuUp) the lists are drawn as the game has them.
