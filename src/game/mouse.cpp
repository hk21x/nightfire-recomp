// The mouse aims on foot as in a PC shooter: its movement turns and pitches Bond's view directly, not through the
// right stick (GameInfo::mouse_direct in default.xbe's exe; the driving levels keep the stick).
//
// The player's movement update 0xA9CF0 (cdecl: the actor, its object, a time scale) reads the turn, move and strafe
// controls (0x6CA20 slots 0-2) and writes the frame's turn at actor +0x28: radians added to the view's heading at the
// next step (turning right is negative), through an acceleration filter (0xB7420, +0x88C) and the stick's value
// squared, which is what made the mouse feel like a stick. The look update 0xB7610 adds the look control to the
// pitch at +0x838 (a quarter turn up is 1, the camera's angle pi/2 times it) and marks the frame looked (+0xF0 = 1:
// otherwise the view eases back level). After 0xA9CF0 for player 1 the mouse's movement since the last
// frame is added to both: so many radians a count at 100% sensitivity, less zoomed in (the camera's field of view
// over the game's 60 degrees, and a quarter of that again: Harry, aiming the sniper rifle and the rocket launcher).
// A frame where the game did not write the turn (a cutscene, another state) gets none.
// Where the player steers something else (a guided missile, a turret: 0xA9CF0 does not write the turn) the mouse plays
// the right stick in the controls 0xDE720 made (nf::MouseAsStick, from src/game/controls.cpp), 20 counts a frame
// full deflection. Auto-aim (the game's option, the byte at +1 of the player's controls, +2 in the mode 0x260018
// flags) is off while the mouse aims: the target search 0xB9950 sees it off for the call, the option stays as set;
// the homing weapons ('P', 'Q') still lock on.
// Headless (no mouse): NF_MOUSE_TEST=dx,dy,from,to plays that many counts a frame for frames from..to.
