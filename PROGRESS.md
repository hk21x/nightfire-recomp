# 007: NightFire recomp - progress log

Newest first. Each entry: date, what changed, what was learned, what's next.

## Status
- Milestone: 3 - plays on Windows. Harry (2026-10-28, D3D12, RX 7900 XT): the Paris driving mission to its end and
  back, then 8 minutes of default.xbe's on-foot play with his saves: no traps, 60 frames a second (a slow frame only
  when a shader compiles). Fixed on the way: black screen (gamma), mission-end crash (Driving.xbe's Reset), menu
  panels (SetPalette), the scope's colours (vertex stream read-back), a D3DX trap (recompiler)
- XDK: 4831 named in the SDK (branch nightfire): default.xbe 137 of 252 functions, Driving.xbe 115 (6 by hand);
  layout proven from NightFire's code
- Push buffers: none
- SDK: the fork's main at 0b5ff49 (2026-10-29: launcher updates; ed5e147 edge bars, unsuspended relaunch; 8acd824 vertex buffer locks wait for the renderer; ed1796c replacements for linear textures; 2026-10-28 ca1d0f9 point sprites) (2026-10-28: nightfire fast-forwarded in after EoN, PGR2 and PGR1 smoke and
  PGR1's frame check); the launcher can build this game now
- PC features (pc-features): skip intro, mouse look and menu mouse, key layouts, PC Settings in the main menu, sharp
  2D, ultrawide and field of view; on Windows (2026-10-29) PC Settings, mounted guns, achievements and the icon
  keypads and ultrawide work
- Smoke: scripts/smoke.sh, title -> START -> Driving.xbe's Paris mission, about 4 minutes

## Log

### 2026-10-30 - The wheel's scope zoom resets when the scope closes (pc-features)

- Harry: zoomed with the wheel, the view stayed zoomed after leaving the scope, for any weapon. The step changed the
  camera's angle (+0x104), which is lasting game state the scope never touches: 0xAAF21's continuous zoom is a free
  camera's (flag +0x50 bit 0 of [+0xB8]), not the scope's. A weapon's zoom is the player's +0x860, copied into the
  camera's divisor (+0xF4) each frame by the first person camera (0xA8BC6); 0xB7190 eases it to the target +0x864,
  kept to 1 .. +0x868 (the weapon's most, at most 50), the zoom control (slot 6) multiplying the target while held;
  leaving the scope sets it back to 1 (0xB9BD1). A notch now multiplies the target by 1.25 (down by as much), within
  those limits, so the game's easing and reset apply. Smoke OK; Harry to check in a scope.

### 2026-10-30 - The wheel's scope zoom, again (pc-features)

- Harry: the wheel did not zoom the sniper scope. The scope's zoom is continuous: 0xAAF21 adds its zoom control
  (slot 6 through 0x6CA20) times the frame's time to the camera's angle (+0x104, kept to 0.2..3.14) and sets the
  camera (0x25190); a notch's 70 ms d-pad press moved it a few frames' worth at most. Now the input thread counts
  the notches through a scope (nf::ScopeZoom) and the look hook (0xA9CF0, the game's thread) steps the angle 0.8
  times a notch up (nearer), out no further than the scope opened at, setting it through 0x25190. Not seen
  headless (no scope there). Smoke OK.
- Repo check before going public: 65 files tracked, history (58 commits, all by Harry's noreply address) holds no
  game files, generated code, secrets or local paths beyond /home/harry folder names in PROGRESS; biggest blob the
  embedded font (OFL). .gitignore now also ignores *.iso and *.xbe anywhere.

### 2026-10-30 - Keys: 1 the next weapon, 2 the next gadget; Shift and Ctrl pitch in the driving missions (pc-features)

- Harry: on foot 1 switches the weapon and 2 to the gadget: 1 is now the d-pad's right (the next weapon, as the wheel)
  and 2 Black (the next gadget, with G); the d-pad's up and down keep the arrows alone (1 and 2 were theirs), left
  keeps 3. Driving: Left Shift is the left stick's up and Left Ctrl its down, beside the arrows (pitch: Deep
  Descent). Only the defaults change: keys bound anew in settings.toml stay. README tables.

### 2026-10-30 - The USA and Europe (En,Fr,De,Es,It,Nl,Sv) discs (pc-features)

- Harry's two more images (.local/variants, unzipped; extracted with an XDVDFS reader in the scratchpad). Europe
  (En,Fr,De,Es,It,Nl,Sv): the same xbes as the supported PAL release; smoke from the .iso OK on a PAL console.
- USA: its xbes differ in the header alone (signature and certificate, regions 1), so GameInfo::same_code takes them
  and the launcher's game.json lists "NTSC (USA)". Its certificate gives an NTSC console: it plays eurocom/30_fps
  (skip_intro now hides the 30_fps EA and MGM logos too) and driving/misc.viv's NTSC\eng movies. Headless from the
  extracted files and from the .iso: MGM logo, title, attract demo, START into Driving.xbe, the Paris intro, the
  sniper tutorial, the chase, Mission Failed. Smoke's driving window (150 s) ends inside the NTSC movie after the
  tutorial (one draw a frame), so it reads FAIL there; a 240 s run plays on (about 380 draws a frame).

### 2026-10-30 - Scope zoom on the wheel, Quit Game in the main menu (pc-features)

- Mouse wheel through a scope: while player 1's view is zoomed in (its angle under 0.9 of 60 degrees: nf::Zoomed, the
  look code's own test, now src/game/mouse.cpp's ViewZoom) the wheel presses the d-pad's up and down, the NightFire
  style's gadget/zoom (the keyboard plays that style), up a notch away; out of a scope it cycles the weapon as before.
  Not tried in a scope headless (no sniper there): which way zooms in is Harry's to check.
- Quit Game: a fifth main menu item (0x1000FC05, the Codenames item's records cloned as PC Settings'), the five rows
  26 apart from 222 to 326 (two rows up ran into the logo); A calls app::Quit, its help line "Leave the game."
  Headless: down four, A: "quit asked for", Exit (0).
- Driving menus' prompts: already Enter for Select in the pause and on Mission Failed (page 5; headless, keyboard):
  the 2026-10-29 fix covers them; nothing to change.

### 2026-10-29 - The launcher's update prompts (pc-features; sdk 0b5ff49)

- Fork main 0b5ff49 (launcher-update, merged by another session after its gate; launcher only): a release launcher
  knows its tag, offers a newer release (Update the launcher, What's new, Later), builds its own tag and offers a
  rebuild that keeps saves. The check is GitHub's unauthenticated API: a private repository gets no prompt.
  release.yml needs nothing (EoN's). My own gate run: PGR2 and EoN smoke OK; PGR1's collided with the PGR1
  session's run in the same trees (frames stopped), not counted.
- docs/releases/v1.0.0.md: an Updates section, today's features; README: modern buttons, Hide HUD, pause PC Settings.
  Smoke OK.

### 2026-10-29 - Modern button pictures, Hide HUD, scope on ultrawide, the driving exe quarantined (pc-features; sdk ed5e147)

- Modern button pictures (modern_buttons, on): a controller's prompts as today's pad (EoN's shapes, sized by each
  box): coloured A B X Y on dark discs, LB/RB for White/Black, LT/RT, Menu/View, d-pads, sticks; Driving.xbe's P8
  icons take the palette's nearest colours, its LT and RT boxes now the caps' full height (rows 111-130, 152-172).
  Headless: main menu, the bot match's CONTROLS tab, Enemies Vanquished's CONTROLS tab.
- Hide HUD (hide_hud): on foot each view's 2D sprite list (0xD9410 from the 2D pass 0xDAC20, the views 0x1F661C) is
  not drawn while no menu is up; driving, the HUD draw 0xE1970 (ecx [0x23F44C]) is skipped in play. Headless: bot
  match and Enemies Vanquished clean, their pause screens drawn.
- Harry's Deep Descent "crash": Windows Defender quarantined NightfireDriving.exe (Behavior:Win32/DefenseEvasion.A!ml),
  so the handover found no exe and closed. SDK 6eb3183: the new exe is no longer started suspended and resumed (the
  handover event is named by the old instance, --handover=pid); a missing exe gets a message box.
- Harry's scope capture on 21:9: the sight's black bars are textured (32x32, x 0-81 and 559-640, full height), so
  they were squeezed and the widened view showed past them. SDK ed5e147: GameInfo::edge_bars (NightFire on) keeps
  such a bar on the frame's edge, as an untextured fill. Windows renderers only: Harry to check.
- Gate passed (EoN, PGR2, PGR1 smoke, PGR1's frame check); fork main fast-forwarded to ed5e147.
- Harry on Windows: modern button pictures, Hide HUD and the scope on ultrawide all work.
- PC Settings from the pause screen (on foot): a level's menu file (stream 834CC5D0 in the bot match; pages 4B, 42,
  4C, 07, 0C, 44, 46, 2F, 21) has no AV Options page, so the front end's AV records are kept when its file is built
  and the page is made from them into the level's file, with the pause panel (0x10000001) behind it at 16,24
  608x432. The choices list (0x10000028 index 6, type 6: ATTR 0x11 texts 0x16A-0x16C) gets PC SETTINGS (a handle
  GetText answers) and room for four (y 176, h 160); A on it with 3 chosen (0x34) opens the page, B comes back.
  Headless: bot match, START, PC SETTINGS, the page, B, the pause screen again. Driving.xbe's pause (EA's menus)
  has none yet.

### 2026-10-29 - Harry's Windows checks

- Confirmed on Windows: mission loading screens whole (sdk 8acd824), PC Settings (resolution text and applying),
  mounted guns with the mouse, achievements, the icon, the Quit game button (F1), driving at 60 frames a second
  (the vertex buffer wait costs nothing seen).
- Keypads with the left mouse button / Enter and ultrawide confirmed too.
- Release notes written (docs/releases/v1.0.0.md). Next: the first release (launcher run, GitHub release), then polish (Hide HUD, modern button pictures,
  PC Settings in the pause menu, Quit Game in the game's menu, mouse prompts in the driving menus).

### 2026-10-29 - Icon, README, launcher name (pc-features)

- Harry's NightFire PC Port artwork: the round logo as launcher/icon.ico (16 to 256 px; the launcher's and both
  exes' icon), the wide one as the README's banner (docs/img/nightfire-pc-port.webp, 1280x720).
- README rewritten from EoN's: supported release (both SHA-1s), launcher and source builds, PC Settings, on-foot and
  driving keys, features, status, troubleshooting, credits (Sour Gummy, OFL).
- launcher.bat still had the template's short name (Game): now NightFire, so it copies NightFireLauncher.exe.

### 2026-10-29 - Mission loading screens whole on Windows (pc-features; sdk 8acd824)

- Harry's F3 capture of a Driving.xbe loading screen (left half black): the picture is 64x64 P8 tiles on stage 3,
  and the first draws carried later tiles' corners (draw 1 at 384,384; headless, draw 1 is at 0,0). Headless the same
  buffer (00260C40) draws at x 64 and later at x 512 in one frame: EAGL refills its ring of three buffers a tile
  (0xF6E90) within the frame, after a lock that blocks in D3D_BlockOnNonSurfaceResource 0x16CE90, which nothing
  named; its wait (BlockOnTime) returns at once, so the render thread read the refilled buffer.
- SDK 8acd824: D3D_BlockOnNonSurfaceResource hosted as BlockUntilNotBusy (wait for the render thread when the
  buffer is still in a batch), 4831 signature from driving.toml (rescans reproduce both configs; default.xbe has none),
  a placeholder address for other builds. About 155 calls a frame in a race; they wait only on a buffer still in
  flight. Headless (no render thread) it is reached from 0xF6E90; NightFire smoke OK. Gate passed (EoN, PGR2, PGR1
  smoke, PGR1's frame check: a live race); fork main fast-forwarded to it.
- Next: Harry to check a mission loading screen, and the frame rate in a driving mission (a wait per refilled buffer).

### 2026-10-29 - Keypads on the keyboard: the left button and Enter confirm (pc-features)

- Harry: a door's keypad took its digits with Ctrl. Its confirm is the pad's A, which the keyboard has as crouch
  (C, Ctrl, the NightFire style's A). Where Bond is not the player's to move on foot (nf::PlayerFree: 0xA9CF0 has not
  turned player 1 for two frames, as for the guided missile; no menu up), the left mouse button and Enter press A too
  (src/common/menu_mouse.cpp) and A's picture is the left button (src/common/buttons.cpp). Not tried at a keypad
  headless (none reached); the bot match's play and smoke OK.

### 2026-10-29 - PC Settings: the resolution's text (pc-features)

- Harry's screenshot: Resolution showed "WUff". The guest copies of the page's strings were found again by their host
  pointer; the sizes' texts lived in a growing vector, so a new text could take an old one's address and get its copy.
  Now by contents, the sizes' texts in a deque, and every string and the menu file copy in AllocHostContiguous memory
  (AllocSystem's pages are not all readable by recompiled code). Smoke OK.

### 2026-10-29 - PC Settings: display mode, resolution, vertical sync, frame cap (pc-features)

- Harry: add display mode, resolution, VSync and the frame cap to the page. Eleven rows do not fit AV's ten, so the
  page is now made from AV's records (nf::PcPage): its page widget, title, prompt line, help box and pictures kept, its
  rows dropped, ours stacked 24 apart from y 80 from three templates (the music slider with its grey track, the
  subtitles choice, the Restore Defaults button); focus moves by position. Choices carry their values (Display Mode
  the runtime's DisplayMode numbers; Resolution "Desktop" 0 and the monitor's sizes 1.., as the settings window
  lists them; Frame Cap 30, 60, 120, 144, 240, Unlimited). Kept: the settings file, and ApplyDisplay when the mode,
  size or aspect changed. Headless: Frame Cap 60 -> 120 and Display Mode Borderless -> Fullscreen kept; the Edit
  Codename route still opens it. Smoke OK.

### 2026-10-29 - PC Settings as a page of the game's own menus (pc-features)

- Harry: the PC settings in the game's menus, as an option of Edit Codename (Codenames, a profile, its list).
- src/game/pc_settings_page.cpp: the AV Options page (0x40000031) cloned into the menu file copy the builder reads
  (pc_settings_item.cpp), its page and row widgets given our ids (0x4000FC10, 0x1000FC11..), its labels ours: Field of
  View and Mouse Sensitivity (the volume sliders, 21 steps), Invert Mouse, Skip Intro Movies, Sharp Text, Aspect Ratio
  (the choices), More Settings (Restore Defaults' button: the settings window); the rest hidden as AV hides its own.
  Driven through the dispatcher 0x8E320 as AV's handler 0x8D7A0 drives its own (0x4C entered: sliders 0x27/0x69/0x2E,
  choices 0x17, 0x10 text and value, 0x1E by value; 0x4B: read 0x40/0x35, kept to the settings file, back 0x5F;
  0x4E: the row's help line).
- Edit Codename's list (table 0x17CEC8, 7 entries) gets an eighth: its range widened as it is made (0x8C7F0, 0x51:
  0x27 0..7), the rows drawn from a copy of the table (0x7F680 called from 0x8C7F0's hook: its own direct call bypasses
  a hook of 0x7F680) with ours at 7 (label and help through a GetText hook, AV's picture), A on it opens the page. The
  copy lives in AllocHostContiguous memory: AllocSystem's pages are not readable by recompiled code (a fault at
  0xB00F30C8); before the list is made its index is a pointer the game wraps, so the copy is used for real indices
  only. kernel::CallGuest returns the guest's eax (the context is restored): reading ctx.eax after gave stale values.
- The main menu's PC Settings item opens the page too. Headless (Harry's save): Codenames -> Default -> the list's
  eighth entry "PC Settings" with its help -> the page; field of view +3 steps and Invert Mouse on kept ("PC Settings
  kept: field of view 115%, ... invert 1"). Smoke OK.

### 2026-10-29 - Achievements (pc-features)

- The progress map (agent, .local/progress_re.md; checked against Harry's decoded save and a faked Enemies Vanquished
  handover, .local/launch_ev_done.bin): FINDINGS.md "Progress". Deltas on the profile cannot tell a codename load
  from a completion (the profile is restored and the completion scored with no frame between), so each achievement is
  the Results page with mode 6 and the level done, plus its own term.
- src/common/achievement_set.cpp: the 12 missions, gold and platinum on any mission, gold and platinum on every
  mission's best, any mission and Equinox on 00 Agent, every Bond Move in a mission (ACHIEVEMENTS.md). Driving.xbe
  gets the list with a never-met condition (shown, not awarded).
- Headless: the faked Enemies Vanquished handover unlocked Enemies Vanquished, Gold Standard and Shaken, Not Stirred
  (Harry's gold there, its Bond Moves); title -> codename BOND -> mission list unlocked none. Smoke OK.

### 2026-10-29 - Driving font on Windows: replacements for linear textures (pc-features; sdk ed1796c)

- Harry's car screenshot: the objective, timer and ammo still in EA's font, though they draw from the replaced
  82E2E580. D3D12's and D3D11's BindGuestTexture took a title's replacement only for a non-linear texture; LIN_A8's
  coordinates are normalised by the guest's size (texsize), so a larger picture reads the same, and A8 decodes to
  white with alpha as the picture is. SDK ed1796c drops the condition. Gate passed (EoN, PGR2, PGR1 smoke, PGR1's
  frame check; none of them sets a replacement on a linear texture); fork main fast-forwarded to it.
- fonts.cpp: Driving.xbe treats any A8 / LIN_A8 texture with EA's glyph table behind it as a font (the table's size
  from the texture's), remembering those that are not. Smoke OK.

### 2026-10-29 - Driving.xbe's font from Sour Gummy Black too (pc-features)

- EA's font file holds its glyph table before its kerning pairs and the pixels (Driving.xbe font 82E2E580: records at
  82E2D080, 12 bytes each, code order: code u16, width, height, x u16, y u16, advance, x offset, y offset from the
  line's top; 191 codes, the printable Latin-1; then the kerning pairs' count 747 and the pairs, "Buy ERTS", the
  pixels). fonts.cpp's EaTable finds it from the texture's data (back to the 0xFF record whose pairs end just before
  the pixels, then down to the space); DrawEaFont draws each code into its rectangle on the line's baseline (the H's
  bottom), sized to the H, fitted; EA's ligature codes (^ | ~ thorn: ffi ffl ff fl) and much-shrunk glyphs keep the
  game's. Headless Paris: "Driving.xbe's font drawn from Sour Gummy Black". Smoke OK.

### 2026-10-29 - Driving pause prompts: Enter for Select, the Scroll icon (pc-features)

- Harry's car pause screenshot: Select showed the mouse (A's play key) and Scroll a stray mark. The atlas's d-pad
  cross was two pictures (a disc with up and down lit at 220,117-239,136; arrow pieces with up and down lit at
  222,137-241,156), boxed as one; now two. Driving.xbe's nf::MenuKeys: a menu up but the pause's CONTROLS tab (the
  HUD's +0x470 == 2) shows Enter and Backspace. Headless car pause: "ENTER Select, ESC Continue, arrows Next and
  Scroll". Smoke OK.

### 2026-10-29 - default.xbe's font from a real font: Sour Gummy Black (pc-features)

- Harry asked for a real font in place of the upscale and picked Google's Sour Gummy Black (SIL OFL 1.1; the static
  Black from upstream eifetx/Sour-Gummy-Fonts, third_party/fonts with OFL.txt; src/common/font_data.cpp its bytes,
  since the headless harness builds src/ alone). stb_truetype (public domain, third_party/stb) draws it.
- default.xbe's 512x64 font: three rows of slots (columns with a clear one between: 63, 62, 25), row 0 ASCII '!' to
  ']' (the menu's "S" at u 399/512 matches), row 1 '`', a-z and Latin-1, row 2 more Latin-1 (ligatures, quotes and a
  box keep the rebuilt mask; no glyph table was found in memory: none of widths, x as bytes, shorts or floats).
  DrawFont: one size (the game's H), each row's baseline (its H, x, a-grave), centred in the slot, narrowed to fit,
  smaller where it would leave its band (ascenders), the game's glyph where that is under 3/4 (accented capitals).
  NF_FONT_DUMP shows the sheet; a line laid out from it on the game's baselines reads cleanly. Driving.xbe's font
  keeps the smooth rebuild (its own layout). Smoke OK.

### 2026-10-29 - Fonts: stairs on shallow curves ironed out (pc-features)

- Harry (Windows screenshot, the objective text): still a bit stepped. Scale2x fixes 45 degree stairs only; shallower
  ones kept bumps through the Catmull-Rom field. Now Scale2x twice, then a Gaussian half a source texel wide over the
  4x mask (separable), then bilinear 2x cut at 0.5 a pixel wide (src/common/fonts.cpp). NF_FONT_DUMP: "/" one clean
  stroke, "0" a smooth oval, the letters' shapes kept. Smoke OK.
- Harry asked about drawing a real font in place of the upscale: possible (stb_truetype, an OFL font like the game's,
  each glyph fitted to its cell and baseline); not started.

### 2026-10-29 - Keyboard prompts in Driving.xbe; clean fonts in both exes (pc-features)

- Driving.xbe's prompts (the pause CONTROLS tab's icons, REF_DRAWLOG draws 513-518) come from its HUD/menu atlas, a
  256x256 P8 (swizzled indices; FNV-1a 0x96C6096C3CB2BF53) the game binds with three palettes; the icons' palette is
  the one whose entry under the A icon is green. src/common/buttons.cpp now has a layout per atlas: the Xbox
  pictures' boxes (from the atlas drawn with that palette), drawn as keys and coded to that palette's nearest
  colours, at the atlas's size (no replacement: it would not follow the palettes). On a mounted gun RT and LT show
  the mouse's buttons and the reload button R; in the car the right stick (look back) its key. Headless car pause,
  CONTROLS: Fire the left button, Handbrake SPACE, C, Gadget the right button, Steer W A S D, S, Q, W, Z.
- Fonts (src/common/fonts.cpp): default.xbe's 512x64 A8R8G8B8 and Driving.xbe's 256x108 LIN_A8 are pixel art; the
  runtime's sharp 2D (interpolation) left stepped rims. Rebuilt 8x: the mask through Scale2x twice (straight strokes
  kept, stairs made diagonals), then a Catmull-Rom field cut at its middle a pixel wide; the colour the nearest
  opaque texel's; the title's replacement (gpu::SetReplacement) wins over the sharpened one. NF_FONT_DUMP=folder
  writes each as built. Headless: both rebuilt (default 8286A000, Driving 81CDBC80 and 82F50180).
- Smoke OK.

### 2026-10-29 - Keyboard prompts on foot: the button pictures show the keys (pc-features)

- Harry: prompts should show the keys, as in EoN. default.xbe draws every prompt (menus' help lines, the pause
  CONTROLS tab, hints) from one 256x128 A8R8G8B8 swizzled atlas with the PS2 and GameCube pictures too (FNV-1a
  0xF0D6752BB8C56E3B, loaded again per level at another address). src/common/buttons.cpp (EoN's buttons.cpp and
  strokes.h adapted): while the keyboard plays, the Xbox pictures' boxes are drawn as each button's first key (in
  the front end's menus A as ENTER, B as BKSP: nf::MenuKeys; a level's pause shows the keys played, which its
  CONTROLS tab lists), the triggers and White as mouse buttons, the d-pads as arrow keys, the left stick W A S D, the
  right the mouse; written to guest memory and 4x for the renderers (gpu::SetReplacement). The HUD binds the atlas
  once, so it is also redrawn from each poll (RefreshButtons) when the look changes.
- The keyboard's style override (style 0) now holds while the keyboard plays, so the game's controls page and
  prompts name the buttons the keys play; a controller puts the chosen style back, and 0x6ED30 (a player's controls
  packed for the profile and launch data) sees the chosen style.
- Headless: the main menu's "Scroll / Select" as the arrow keys and ENTER; the bot match's CONTROLS tab with every
  picture a key or mouse button (its style text was the controller's: pad script presses are a controller's).
- Driving.xbe: its prompts are glyphs of its LIN_A8 256x108 font tinted by vertex colour (the CONTROLS tab's icons),
  not a picture atlas: not done yet.
- Smoke OK.

### 2026-10-28 - PC controls in Driving.xbe: the mounted guns, the car, the menus (pc-features)

- Harry: the on-foot controls did not reach the vehicle missions (Alpine Escape's snowmobile turret, the Paris van's
  gun, the car). Reverse engineering in .local/driving_input_re.md (angles in turns; the control files are text in
  driving/misc.viv: data\control\povcfg0-7.def for the guns, drivecfg.def for the car).
- Mounted guns (src/driving/mouse.cpp): the gun camera's update 0x857D0 (fastcall) adds the stick's rates to +0x1EC
  yaw and +0x1E8 pitch (up a smaller pitch) and clamps them (0x83190). The mouse's counts go into both before the
  call, the stick's part (+0x290/+0x294, +0x2A0/+0x2A4, ramp +0x1F0/+0x1F4) zeroed; slower zoomed (+0xB4 over 33
  degrees) and a quarter again. Auto-aim [0x2445D0] (default.xbe's option through the launch data, read only by
  0x82E00 from 0x857D0) is off for the call and its lock let go. Headless Alpine Escape with MOUSER: the turret turns.
- Car or gun: the control map's mode [0x1E4560] (1 gun, 0 car), the gun's style [0x1E4568] (nf::GunStyle). On a gun
  the keyboard's car buttons are taken off: the left button fires (RT), the right zooms (LT), R reloads (X in style 0,
  else A); the wheel cycles weapons (its style's controls). In the car: the keys from its controls page (W gas, S
  brake, A/D steer, mouse left fire, Space handbrake, E/mouse right gadget, C camera, Q/Z weapons, V look back), the
  wheel Black/White.
- Menus: the HUD's byte [[0x23F44C]+0x2B0] while an in-game menu takes input (nf::MenuUp): the mouse in Paused and
  Mission Failed. Headless Paris: pause and resume logged.
- mouse_direct in both exes now (NF_DRIVING_EXE dropped). Smoke OK.

### 2026-10-28 - Driving.xbe trap in the car mission (pc-features)

- Harry (Windows, "Enemies Vanquished", 117 s in): "indirect call to 00081D10 has no recompiled function" from
  0x8783F: a state's update (+0x14 of the 0x18-byte entries at [0x1EC368], stored by 0x78770 at 0x79405), reached
  only through that table. Added to config/driving.toml [functions]. A sweep of both xbes' code for function
  addresses stored as immediates (mov [reg+d], imm; push imm) with no recompiled function found no other.
- Headless with Harry's save (.local/hdd_harry, from his hdd.zip; codename BOND): default.xbe's NightFire item ->
  mission list -> Enemies Vanquished wrote .local/launch_enemies_vanquished.bin; 5 minutes of driving with the gas
  held (to a wreck and "Mission Failed"): no trap.
- The car's own controls page (pause, CONTROLS): A fire, B handbrake, Y camera, X gadget, d-pad left/right cycle
  weapons, left stick steer, L brake/reverse, R gas, Black/White weapon forward/back, right stick look back.
- Next: Driving.xbe's controls for the keyboard and mouse (the mounted gun's aim, auto-aim, car vs gun layout, the
  menus): being reverse-engineered (.local/driving_input_re.md).

### 2026-10-28 - Guided missile steered by the mouse; auto-aim off with the mouse (pc-features)

- Harry: a guided missile flew straight (WASD and the mouse did nothing); auto-aim locked onto chests.
- Steering something else, the player's movement update 0xA9CF0 does not turn player 1, so the direct mouse had
  nothing to drive and the right stick got nothing. After 0xDE720, two frames without 0xA9CF0's turn (and no menu
  up), the mouse plays the right stick in the controls (style 0's slots 0, 3 x and 4, 5 y, -1 to 1; 20 counts a
  frame full). Not tried headless (no guided missile in the bot match); the log says "the mouse plays the right stick".
- Auto-aim: the game's option is the byte at +1 of the player's controls (0x1FE6D1; the options page 0x8D0F0 widget
  0x1000011B; +2 in the mode 0x260018 flags); its target search 0xB9950 runs with it. While the keyboard and mouse
  play, 0xB9950 sees both off for the call (the option as set; homing weapons 'P' and 'Q' still lock on).
- Smoke OK; the bot match's direct mouse unchanged.

### 2026-10-28 - On-foot keys from the game's own controls page; the weapon wheel; zoomed mouse a quarter (pc-features)

- Harry: the mouse is excellent; zoomed in (sniper, rocket launcher) it wants a quarter the speed; E for action,
  C or Ctrl crouch, the wheel for weapons, R reload.
- The game's controls page (pause, CONTROLS tab, headless in the bot match) for every style; the style number is
  player +0xE (Classic Bond 7, GoldenEye 6, Thunderball 5, Dr. No 4, Goldfinger 3, Octopussy 2, Moonraker 1,
  NightFire 0). NightFire (the keyboard's): A crouch, X reload/action, Y jump, B next weapon, White alt. fire, Black
  next gadget, L manual aim, R fire, Back vision mode, d-pad left/right cycle weapon, up/down gadget/zoom. The old
  keys were from a guess (Space was crouch, E jump).
- Keys: C/Ctrl crouch, E/R action and reload, Space jump, Q/Backspace next weapon, middle button/F alt. fire, G next
  gadget, V/Tab vision mode, arrows/1-4 the d-pad; the wheel cycles the weapon in play (down the next), Enter selects
  in the menus (menu_mouse.cpp).
- Mouse zoomed in (the camera's angle over its zoom divisor under 0.9 of 60 degrees): a quarter again; the log says
  "zoomed in" and "zoomed out" so Harry's log shows the test works.
- Headless (KEYS, MOUSER, WHEELD in the bot match): the style override (7 -> 0) and the direct mouse logged. Smoke OK.

### 2026-10-28 - The mouse turns the view itself on foot; on-foot play headless; the snow (pc-features)

- Harry: the mouse as the right stick is no FPS mouse (dead spots, a ramp). default.xbe takes the mouse itself now
  (GameInfo::mouse_direct; NF_DRIVING_EXE keeps Driving.xbe on the stick), src/game/mouse.cpp:
  - The movement update 0xA9CF0 (the actor) writes the frame's turn at actor +0x28: radians added to the heading
    next step (right negative), after an acceleration filter (0xB7420) and the stick squared. The look update 0xB7610
    adds to the pitch at +0x838 (camera pitch = pi/2 times it) and sets +0xF0 = 1 (looked; without it the view
    eases back level). After 0xA9CF0 for player 1 the mouse's counts go straight into both, 0.0008 radians a count
    at 100% sensitivity, scaled by the camera's field of view over 60 degrees (the scope).
  - Headless: NF_MOUSE_TEST=100,60,600,619: the camera turned 0.08 a frame and pitched 0.048 a frame to 0.96 and held.
  - The dead zone rewrite (0xE76A0) is gone: the mouse no longer plays the stick on foot.
- Found by probing: getter 0x6CA20 (player, slot): slot k is the float at 0x1FE6E4 + player * 0x158 + 4k (0 turn,
  1 and 2 moving, 3-5 looking); style 0 fills the turn from the right stick. The headless Multiplayer profile turns
  with the left stick (not style 0), so the keyboard's style override stays.
- On-foot play headless: scripts/pad/mp_bots.txt (Multiplayer, one bot, Skyrail) from launch_quit_to_menu.bin.
- The snow (Harry's F3 captures): one fixed-function point-sprite draw of 4096 points with its texture on stage 3,
  stage 0 holding the last draw's (ferns, spheres, stripes). SDK branch nightfire-pointsprite: such a draw uses stage 3
  as its first stage (the Xbox gives point sprite coordinates to stage 3 alone). Gate passed (EoN, PGR2, PGR1 smoke,
  PGR1's frame check; PGR2's point sprites all have a pixel shader, PGR1 and EoN draw none): fork main ca1d0f9.
- Smoke OK.

### 2026-10-28 - The mouse past the game's stick dead zone (pc-features)

- Harry: dead spots in the mouse movement. default.xbe's poll 0xE76A0 makes each stick axis a float, -100 to 100
  (0x1620E0), takes a dead zone off it and stretches the rest (0xE79CF..); slow mouse moves fell inside it. While
  the keyboard and mouse play, controller 1's right stick floats are remade after the poll from the XInputGetState
  shorts, linear, the runtime's 20% mouse start taken off (src/game/controls.cpp). Sensitivity: the overlay's
  mouse sensitivity (10-1000%); the game's top turn rate stays its own.
- Smoke OK. Next: Harry: slow aiming, and the snow captures (F3).

### 2026-10-28 - Keyboard and mouse always as the NightFire controller style (pc-features)

- Harry (Windows): the field of view works; on foot the mouse strafed and moved Bond about, and A/D did not strafe.
- default.xbe's 0xDE720 reads the pads into each player's controls by the player's controller style (u16 at +0xE of
  a 0x158-byte player, port byte at +0x156): style 0 (NightFire) takes moving and strafing from the left stick,
  turning and looking from the right; 2 and 5 (Octopussy, Thunderball by the options' order) swap the x axes. The
  keys and mouse are laid out for style 0, so while controller 1 is on the keyboard and mouse its player is read as
  style 0 for the call (src/game/controls.cpp; the chosen style is logged); a controller keeps its style.
- Smoke OK. Next: Harry on Windows: WASD moves and strafes, the mouse turns and looks, in his save's style.

### 2026-10-28 - PC Settings in the main menu, menu mouse, sharp 2D, ultrawide and field of view (pc-features)

- PC Settings: a fourth main-menu item under NightFire / Multiplayer / Codenames, in the game's own font and focus
  (src/game/pc_settings_item.cpp). Eurocom's menus are a record stream ([0x25FB08]) the page builder 0x93960 reads:
  the builder gets a copy with the Codenames item's records cloned under our id (0x1000FC01) and label, the items moved
  up a row; A on it (dispatcher 0x8E320, message 0x4B) opens the overlay; its help line is set after 0x959E0.
  Headless: shown, focused with its help line, A logs "PC Settings opened from the main menu".
- Mouse in the menus (EoN's MenuMouse): left A, right B, the wheel the d-pad while a menu is up. default.xbe tells
  by Eurocom's menu context (player 1's page widget, 0x25F38C); Driving.xbe's EA menus are not found yet (never up).
- sharpen_2d on (text and HUD sharp at high resolutions; the overlay's sharp_2d turns it off).
- Ultrawide and fov_percent (50-150, both exes; .local/fov_re.md has the reverse engineering):
  - default.xbe (src/game/view.cpp): the D3D projection 0xDD950 and the culling planes 0xDB5C0 get the camera's
    aspect (+0x100) times the frame's width over 16:9 and its angle (+0x104) scaled, for the call alone (the scope's
    zoom and a cutscene camera read those fields back); 0x25190's pixel scales (+0xEC/+0xF0: HUD markers, aim ray)
    follow the field of view, not ultrawide (the HUD is squeezed). Not run headless: no on-foot level is reached
    (the Paris pad ends at "Mission Failed").
  - Driving.xbe (src/driving/view.cpp): 0xE46D0's horizontal angle widened in tangent and its aspect with it (the
    height unchanged); the field of view scales the game's multiplier [[0x1EBFF4]+0x58] around 0x96EB0 and the HUD
    markers 0xCE2B0. Headless Paris: NF_FOV=130 shows more of the scene; NF_ULTRAWIDE=2 (a headless override) gives a
    picture half as wide at the same height, as a 32:9 screen stretches it back. squeeze_screen_programs on: every
    driving draw is a vertex program, the HUD's 640x480 quads too.
- Smoke OK (147 draws a frame).
- Next: Harry on Windows: PC Settings from the main menu, the menus with the mouse, the layout against the game's
  control labels, aspect = fill at 21:9 or 32:9 (edge pop-in, the HUD squeezed, aim at the edges on foot:
  0xB7EB0 keeps 16:9), the field of view; the log should say "out of the menus" in play.

### 2026-10-28 - PC features begun: skip intro, mouse look, keyboard layouts (pc-features)

- skip_intro (settings, NF_SKIP_INTRO=1 headless): default.xbe's EA (25_fps/07370048.xmv) and MGM (07380048) logo
  movies reported missing through GameInfo::hide_file; the game passes over them and "Press START" is up at 15 s
  instead of 26 s; the language select (07350048, its background) stays.
- Mouse look: GameInfo::mouse_look (the mouse plays the right stick, both exes). Keyboard layouts per exe as EoN's
  (kDriving in each hooks.cpp; Driving.xbe's rebinds kept as [driving_keys]): on foot WASD, mouse fire/aim, Space,
  Ctrl, R, E, F, Q, 1-4 the d-pad, Esc/P start, Tab back; driving W accelerate (RT), S brake/reverse (A), A/D steer.
  The game's own control labels (text bank 0): Fire, Jump, Alt. Fire, Crouch, Reload/Action, Look/Strafe, Vision
  Mode, Cycle Weapon, Cycle Gadget/Zoom, Manual Aim, Next Weapon/Gadget, Pause: the layout is to be checked against
  them in game.
- The main menu's text: GetText 0x6D460 (handle = bank << 24 | n, bank bases at [[0x1FEC78] + bank * 4], the
  table at [0x215588]); main menu handles 0x148 NightFire, 0x149 Multiplayer, 0x14A Options (not shown: a hidden
  item), 0x14B Codenames. The menu itself is data-driven; its items are being traced (.local/menu_re.md), as are
  the projection and culling of both engines for ultrawide and FOV (.local/fov_re.md).

### 2026-10-28 - The SDK branch in fork main (main; sdk 41ac590)

EoN's smoke had not failed: its default length is 240 s and 150 s ends inside its intro movie (EoN's session; the
note was wrong). Gate on the nightfire tip: EoN main 2146a11 with its SDK bfbdc0a merged with nightfire SMOKE OK
(race 11736 draws a frame, /home/harry/eon-soak); PGR2 SMOKE OK (2007); PGR1 SMOKE OK (2811) and its frame check a
live race (.local/mm/after.png, draws 6156269 -> 6242839 a second apart). The recompiler change regenerates PGR2's
and PGR1's code byte for byte. Fork main fast-forwarded 0ade542 -> 41ac590 (14 commits); this repository already
pins it.

Next: PC features: skip intro, widescreen, FOV, mouse aim and menus, PC settings in the game's own menu.

### 2026-10-28 - Windows: a long session clean (main)

Harry: "a fair bit of gameplay, all worked OK": 469 s in default.xbe (his saves; the on-foot side), no errors, 60
frames a second paced, slow frames only on shader compiles (1 to 5 a 10 s window, longest 214 ms at boot).

Next: the SDK branch into fork main once EoN's smoke works again (then the launcher builds NightFire); later
missions; PC features (widescreen, FOV, skip intro) as the other ports have.

### 2026-10-28 - default.xbe trapped at 0x11234A: an instruction past the raw data (main; sdk nightfire)

Harry's next run (with his saves, so default.xbe stays in its menus) trapped after 39 s: "undecodable instruction"
at 0x11234A, from the game's 0xE83A8 (D3DX 0x111FC0, a matrix inverse). The D3DX section's raw data ends at
0x11234C, its virtual size at 0x112350: the function's last instruction, ret 0xC (C2 0C 00), has its last byte in
the zero filled tail the loader maps. sdk xbe_recomp: Decode pads with the tail's zeros, and an instruction that
starts in code may run into its own section's tail. Forza's FZFULLUI had the same trap (0x3A9AEA); PGR2, PGR1 and
EoN had none, so their code does not change. Smoke OK.

### 2026-10-28 - Menu panels: Driving.xbe's SetPalette (main; sdk nightfire)

Harry's rebuild: no crash; the scope shows the view inside it now (dim) but not yet as it should, and the menu
panels (Paused, Mission Failed) were black and white noise, also headless. Their textures are P8 (format 0x0B).
0x1669E0 stores a palette in the device's slot [+0xB48 + stage * 4] and pushes 0x41B20 + stage * 0x40 itself (EoN's
QFE 4 SetPalette does the same): D3DDevice_SetPalette, unnamed, so the host never had a palette (and logged
"MakeSpace from 00166A4E"). Named: the Mission Failed panel draws right headless. Smoke OK.

Next: the scope on Windows after this build (the readback of 2026-10-28 made the view show; brightness and the
noise pattern still to compare with the console).

### 2026-10-28 - Leaving Paris crashed; the sniper scope black (main; sdk nightfire)

Harry's Windows run reached the end of the first mission, then crashed: an access violation in the heap's free
(0x110BA6 from RtlFreeHeap) through D3DResource_Release 0x169230 from the game's teardown 0xE8600. Reproduced headless
by quitting a failed mission to the menu (render thread on or off). gdb on the releases: the object is the host's
depth buffer (header 0x00050001: one reference, no internal one), and library code at 0x16D23D had dropped the
device's hold: the frame buffer teardown 0x16D180 inside Driving.xbe's D3DDevice_Reset 0x166230, unnamed, so the
library's Reset ran on the host's buffers. Named (PGR2's 0x1C38D0 at 0.96): the host Reset runs, and the quit now
relaunches into default.xbe, which comes up on the main menu. Smoke OK.

Visual: the sniper scope is black (both renderers). Probes and traces at the scope's centre: draw 158 multiplies
the view by a texture that is near black, the 128x128 target 0x80F07000, a decaying accumulator a black quad dims
each frame and 16384 points (128 x 128) add to. The points' colour stream is the memory of the other 128x128
target 0x80F17000, which the pass before drew from the back buffer: the console reads those texels as vertex
colours; here the GPU's pixels never reached guest memory, the points added zeros and the accumulator stayed black.
sdk: before a draw each vertex stream's data is read back when the GPU drew it, and the D3D12/D3D11 read-backs
write 32 bit swizzled targets in Morton order (they skipped every swizzled one). Headless cannot show it (the null
backend has no GPU targets); wincheck and smoke OK. The icon-atlas frame in Harry's captures runs the same passes.
Ruled out on the way: linear texture coordinates as 0..1 (experiment: no change, the HUD text broke).

Next: Harry rebuilds and checks the scope, the atlas frame and the end of the mission.

### 2026-10-28 - Windows: the first mission was black; the gamma ramp (main; sdk nightfire)

Harry's first Windows build (D3D12, RX 7900 XT) boots, plays the movies and the title, relaunches into Driving.xbe
and then shows black in the first mission. His F3 capture (.local/win) has the frame drawn right (final.bmp: the
van's sniper view), so the picture was lost after the draws. The device's gamma ramps in his memory dump are zeros,
and the game's own base ramp at 0x23FC08 too: Driving.xbe reads the current ramp once with the library's
D3DDevice_GetGammaRamp 0x165E70 (copies [device + 0x259C + slot * 0x300]) and every fade is that ramp scaled
(0xE7740: base * scale + 0.5, then SetGammaRamp). The host never put a ramp in the device: its SetGammaRamp goes to
the GPU only, and the console's linear ramp was never there, so every fade was black. The reference renderer has no
gamma, so headless never showed it. sdk: CreateDevice writes the linear ramp into both slots and SetGammaRamp keeps
them current. Headless the saved base is now linear (0, 32 ... 224); smoke OK.

Next: Harry rebuilds (build.bat updates the sdk) and checks the mission shows.

### 2026-10-28 - Ready for a first Windows build (main; sdk nightfire)

- Gate on the branch: PGR2 smoke OK (2009 draws a frame), PGR1 smoke OK. EoN smoke fails at 1 draw a frame (the
  intro movie in1_palw.xmv never ends) on fork main's SDK, on its own pinned SDK 9e5900b and merged with this branch
  alike, in /home/harry/eon-soak and in EoN's own tree: an EoN problem of its own, so fork main is not moved yet.
- Windows checks: scripts/wincheck.sh clean; scripts/shadercheck.sh compiles all 41 shaders the two xbes made (4 in
  default.xbe's boot, 37 in the Paris level), 0 failed.
- build.bat is EoN's (both exes); the sdk submodule is the pushed nightfire branch's commit, so a clone builds
  without fork main. The launcher builds from fork main and cannot build this game until the merge.

### 2026-10-28 - Pad scripts and a smoke test across the two xbes (main; sdk nightfire)

PAL boot (frames every 120, no input): language select 120..600 (it moves on by itself), the EA and MGM movies to
1200, the title from 1440, "Press START" from about 1560 (24 draws a frame). scripts/pad/smoke.txt: A at 300, START
at 2000; the relaunch follows at about 34 s.

Driving.xbe, Paris (scripts/pad/paris.txt, vblanks from its own start): the sniper tutorial from about 1500 passes
on RT every 40 vblanks with auto-aim; its closing movie leads (about 5100) into the Aston Martin's chase. RT
accelerates; A brakes and reverses (A+RT reversed into the camera). Unsteered, the car meets the barriers and the
mission fails to its menu at about 7200 (A there replays the tutorial). Movie decoding makes frame times vary
between runs, so presses after a movie are timed loosely.

sdk: smoke.sh takes a second xbe (SMOKE_NEXT_GEN/NAME/PAD/SECS): the first run must relaunch, the next xbe runs on
its disk and launch data and gets the drawing checks; SMOKE_SECS. NightFire: SMOKE OK (title 24 draws a frame,
Paris 146); without START it fails ("no relaunch"); PGR1's smoke unchanged on the branch.

Next: steering through the chase (the harness's cmd file takes presses live), PGR2 / EoN smoke and PGR1's frame
check, then the branch into fork main and a Windows build.

### 2026-10-27 - The Paris mission plays headless (main; sdk nightfire)

After the intro movie Driving.xbe stopped three times, each an XDK function only it links:
1. D3D 0x16B160 read the current pixel shader's definition ([[pDevice]+0x370]+8, null with hosted shaders):
   D3DDevice_SetPixelShaderConstant (its opening is PGR2's 0x1C27C0 instruction for instruction, ret 0xC).
2. DSOUND 0x17BE1B -> 0x17BAF4 copies a DSI3DL2LISTENER: IDirectSound_SetI3DL2Listener.
3. 73 s in, a 0x15000 byte contiguous allocation failed with 64156 KB in use. XBE_MEM_LOG=2 (new, sdk) summed the
   live blocks by caller: the game's own 36 MB heap (0x10E818), its D3D resources (454 blocks, 6.9 MB), its render
   targets, and 10 MB the host made: three swap buffers and the depth buffer, as a console makes, plus a copy target
   (1.2 MB) and the DrawVerticesUP ring (4 MB) no console has. sdk: physical memory is mapped to 128 MB as on a
   development kit; the title's allocator and statistics keep the console's 64 MB and the host's own buffers (copy
   target, UP ring, scratch push) come from the part past it. Then 200 s of the mission without a trap. PGR1's
   smoke passes on the branch.

Names signed into sdk/xdk/4831 from both hand configs (.local/resign.sh); both rescans reproduce every hand name.

Next: a pad script through the mission (and the front end: START at the title went straight into mission 1 with the
"Default" profile), a smoke test across the two exes, then PGR2 / EoN smoke and PGR1's frame check before the
branch goes into fork main; a Windows build for Harry.

### 2026-10-27 - XDK 4831 named; title screen; Driving.xbe reached and plays its intro movie (main; sdk nightfire)

Named with three parallel read-only passes (D3D functions and data, the D3D layout, DSOUND), each against PGR2's 5659
bodies (instruction sequences with numbers masked, callees followed) and checked on NightFire's own instructions;
XAPI/XPP by hand. Evidence is in config/nightfire.toml, sdk/xdk/4831/layout.toml and .local/match/result_*.txt.
- D3D: 51 functions by body, render state slot and push methods (byte-identical setters told apart by slot); the
  data (pDevice 0x1117C0, RenderState 0x1119D0, PresentInterval 0x111BCC, ...) found by both D3D passes alike.
- Layout: 5659's way on every 3948/5659 difference (state numbering, Swap, frame buffer pointers, present interval
  global, D3DPRESENT_PARAMETERS to +0x40, D3DVBLANKDATA); device size 0x2C30, miniport at +0x23C0. Spot-checked.
- DSOUND: 41 functions by their chains to the leaf (4831 has no .XTLID). The scan had SetMixBins/SetMixBinVolumes
  swapped. Mix bins as 5659, headroom as 3948.
- Signed into sdk/xdk/4831 from default.xbe (137 of 252); both rescans reproduce the hand names. Driving.xbe's 100
  shared library names compared with default.xbe's by call chain (all 0.97 or more).

Boot, one stop at a time:
1. XInitDevices unnamed: the USB driver touched 0xFED00000. Named (0x15753D) with XInputOpen/Close, XDEVICE_TYPE_GAMEPAD.
2. Direct3D_CreateDevice unnamed: 0xFD001804. With the D3D names: 120 s without a trap, the title screen (REF frames).
3. START launches driving.xbe: EA's front end and driving levels are that xbe, so it is on the main path. Its XPP
   table init 0x183BF4 needed `[functions]` as default.xbe's did; DirectSoundCreateBuffer 0x17C2A0 (default.xbe does
   not link it) and IDirectSoundBuffer_SetFilter 0x17B5E0 (4831's Driving.xbe DSOUND has it, default.xbe's not) named
   by hand after APU faults.
4. Driving.xbe then hung after 60 frames in a stream loop (0x14C800): EA's file layer opened
   `NTSC\eng\paris_intro.mad`, which is not on the disc, and a failed open leaves the stream busy for good. The movies
   are in driving/misc.viv under `pal\<language>\`: the video standard default.xbe passes in the launch data
   (offset 0xE1C) was NTSC. `GameInfo::pal_console` (as EoN): default.xbe then shows the language select and the
   three XMV intro movies, which needed D3DDevice_GetRasterStatus hosted (sdk: the XMV player read the CRTC
   register 0x600808 through the GPU base); its launch data now says PAL and Driving.xbe plays the Paris intro movie.
   Tried first: disc reads paced at 6 MB/s (60 -> 240 frames, not the cause), OBJECT_PATH_NOT_FOUND for a missing
   folder (no change, reverted).

Tools: .local/drv.sh (recompile and run Driving.xbe from .local/launch_title_start_pal.bin), .local/drvstack.sh
(thread stacks of a hang), .local/tools/{seq,align,ident,xmatch,chain}.py (matching).

Next: the crash after the Paris movie in D3D 0x16B160 (Driving.xbe, reading [null + 8]; from game 0xF44A0).

### 2026-10-27 - Repository set up; first scans and first boot attempt (main; sdk nightfire)

Chosen from the two discs dumped today: NightFire is fully extracted and has the same two-xbe structure as EoN, and
its console game differs from the Gearbox PC port. (True Crime: New York City's extract stopped before default.xbe;
its default.xbe from the .iso is XDK 5849 with LTCG D3D8, 116 of 278 functions on a first scan: a later candidate.)

Made from `sdk/templates/game` with EoN's two-xbe wiring: targets `Nightfire` (default.xbe, src/game, config/
nightfire.toml) and `NightfireDriving` (Driving.xbe, src/driving, config/driving.toml), `GameInfo::images`, both exes
in launcher/game.json and release.bat, the workflow title quoted. LESSONS.md collects what PGR2, EoN, PGR1 and Forza
learned.

SDK (branch `nightfire`):
- `xdk/4831`: no signatures existed. Trial scans seeded from each build: 3948 23 functions, 5659 54, 5849 55 (5849
  has more names, the same hits); seeded from 5659 as PGR1 was. layout.toml is 5659's, marked unverified.
- xbe_symbols: default.xbe's scan named 0x15B5D5 XInputGetCapabilities by constants (0.60) though it pops 4 bytes,
  not 8, and wrote an `[abi]` placeholder the recompiler refuses. 0x15B5D5 is an XPP device type's callback (the
  descriptor 0x15731C's +8), not XInputGetCapabilities. Now, in an image without LTCG, a constants match whose ret
  size or entry registers differ is not taken. PGR2, PGR1, EoN (both) and Forza rescans are byte-identical.
- ghidra.sh: `GHIDRA_PROGRAM=driving.exe` reads a second xbe's program.

First headless runs (default.xbe, none.txt):
1. 0.024 s: indirect call to 0x157334 from 0x15757B, which walks XPP's device type table 0x157214..0x157220
   (descriptors 0x1572D8, 0x1572F0, 0x15731C; +4 init, +8 and +0xC callbacks). Only 0x157334 had no function:
   `[functions]` in config/nightfire.toml.
2. Segfault at guest 0xFED00000, the USB host controller's registers: XInitDevices is 0x15753D (allocates the 0xB4
   byte host object, runs the table's inits, starts the controller; stdcall, 2 arguments) and was unnamed, so the
   library's driver ran. The host's XInitDevices needs XPP_GamepadType and the XPP_Current/Changed/Previous layout
   keys, which are still 5659's: naming it belongs to the 4831 pass.

Push buffers (sdk/scripts/ghidra PushBufferScan): all 226 NV2A method stores are in library code, none in the game's
.text, so the game writes no commands by hand. The 0x20001 store in D3D 0x109790 is the lazy state flush's method
value, not a push buffer resource. Whether the game records or runs push buffers stays open until D3D is named.

Recompile: default.xbe 4640 functions (357 direct, 740 by gap fill, 3925 overlapping decodes); the 31 "code
addresses not made functions" at 0x40290-0x403A0 are NV2A method headers in D3D immediates, not code.

Next: Plan 1, the 4831 pass. Name D3D, DSOUND, XPP (XInitDevices 0x15753D first) in default.xbe against PGR1's 3948
and PGR2's 5659 in Ghidra, re-derive the layout, sign, rescan both xbes; then settle push buffers and boot.
